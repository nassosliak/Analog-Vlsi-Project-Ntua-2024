abstract = {An Integrated Analog Gaussian Mixture Model classifier architecture is introduced consisting of multiple Gaussian function circuits and a Winner-Take-All circuit. It is modular and scalable to the number of classes and clusters, and, to the input dimensionality. The operating principles of the classifier are illustrated in detail and are used in a low-power, low-voltage and fully-tunable implementation targeting bearing fault management applications. The implementation was done in a 90nm CMOS process using the Cadence IC Suite for the electrical and physical design. Post-layout simulation results were compared with a software implementation of the classifier confirming the proper operation of the design.}

title = "K-Winners-Take-All Circuit with O(N) Complexity",
abstract = "In this letter we present a k-winners-take-all circuit that is an extension of the winner-take-ail circuit by Lazzaro et al. [4], The problem of selecting the largest k numbers is formulated as a mathematical programming whose solution scheme, based on the Lagrange multiplier method, is directly implemented on an analog circuit. The wire length in this circuit grows only linearly with the number of elements, and the circuit is more suitable for real-time processing than the Hopfield networks because the present circuit produces the solution almost instantaneouslyâ€”in contrast to the Hopfield network, which requires transient convergence to the solution from a precise initial state. The selection resolution in the present circuit is, however, only finite in contrast to the almost infinite resolution in the Hopfield networks.",

ABSTRACT = {This review paper explores existing architectures, operating principles, performance metrics and applications of analog Gaussian function circuits. Architectures based on the translinear principle, the bulk-controlled approach, the floating gate approach, the use of multiple differential pairs, compositions of different fundamental blocks and others are considered. Applications involving analog implementations of Machine Learning algorithms, neuromorphic circuits, smart sensor systems and fuzzy/neuro-fuzzy systems are discussed, focusing on the role of the Gaussian function circuit. Finally, a general discussion and concluding remarks are provided.},
