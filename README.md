# Analog GMM Classifier

## Overview

This project is part of the **Analog VLSI class at NTUA**. The goal is to design and implement an **analog Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier** using **Cadence**. The classifier is tested on multiple datasets, including the **IRIS dataset**, **Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset**, and **Thyroid Disease dataset**.

The project also compares the performance of the hardware-based analog classifier with a software-based implementation. For more detailed information on the implementation and results, please refer to the `report.pdf` file.

## Hardware Implementation

The analog GMM classifier was designed using **Cadence** VLSI design tools. The focus is on creating a hardware-efficient solution for classification tasks based on the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), offering advantages in speed and power efficiency.
